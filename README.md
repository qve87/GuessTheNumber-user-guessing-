# GuessTheNumber-user-guessing-

It is a simple version of Guess The number game. 
You can choose your difficulty and according to your choice, the amount of lives (guesses) will be various.
Computer range number is up to you, so choose wisely.

Mostly I used "if statements" to create this game.

Have fun!
